# Tavily JavaScript SDK

Tavily's JavaScript SDK allows for easy interaction with the Tavily API, offering the full range of our search and extract functionalities directly from your JavaScript and TypeScript programs. Easily integrate smart search and content extraction capabilities into your applications, harnessing the powerful Tavily Search and Tavily Extract APIs.

## Installing

```bash
npm i @tavily/core
```

# Tavily Search

Connect your LLM to the web using the Tavily Search API. Tavily Search is a powerful search engine tailored for use by LLMs in agentic applications.

## Usage

Below is a simple code snippet that shows you how to use Tavily Search. The different steps and components of this code are explained in more detail on the JavaScript [API Reference](https://docs.tavily.com/sdk/get-started/javascript) page.

```javascript
const { tavily } = require("@tavily/core");

// Step 1. Instantiating your Tavily client
const tvly = tavily({ apiKey: "tvly-YOUR_API_KEY" });

// Step 2. Executing a simple search query
const response = await tvly.search("Who is Leo Messi?");

// Step 3. That's it! You've done a Tavily Search!
console.log(response);
```

# Tavily Extract

The Tavily Extract API allows you to effortlessly retrieve raw content from a list of websites, making it ideal for data collection, content analysis, and research. You can also combine Tavily Extract with our Search method: first, obtain a list of relevant documents, then perform further processing on selected links to gather additional information and use it as context for your research tasks.

## Usage

Below is a simple code snippet demonstrating how to use Tavily Extract. The different steps and components of this code are explained in more detail on the JavaScript [API Reference](https://docs.tavily.com/docs/javascript-sdk/tavily-extract/api-reference) page.

```javascript
const { tavily } = require("@tavily/core");

// Step 1. Instantiating your TavilyClient
const tvly = tavily({ apiKey: "tvly-YOUR_API_KEY" });

// Step 2. Defining the list of URLs to extract content from
const urls = [
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence",
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning",
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science",
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing",
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change",
]; // You can provide up to 20 URLs simultaneously

// Step 3. Executing the extract request
response = await tvly.extract(urls);

// Step 4. Printing the extracted raw content
for (let result of response.results) {
  console.log(`URL: ${result.url}`);
  console.log(`Raw Content: ${result.rawContent}\n`);
}
// Note that URLs that could not be extracted will be stored in response.failedResults
```

# Tavily Crawl (Open-Access Beta)

Tavily Crawl is an agent‐first site explorer that leverages breadth‐first crawling to navigate websites. It uses natural-language goals to intelligently uncover deeply buried “needle-in-a-haystack” information or perform high-volume data retrieval across an entire site.

## Usage

Below is a simple code snippet demonstrating how to use Tavily Crawl. The different steps and components of this code are explained in more detail on the JavaScript [API Reference](https://docs.tavily.com/docs/javascript-sdk/tavily-crawl/api-reference) page.

```javascript
const { tavily } = require("@tavily/core");

// Step 1. Instantiating your Tavily client
const tvly = tavily({ apiKey: "tvly-YOUR_API_KEY" });

// Step 2. Defining the starting URL to crawl
const start_url = "https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon"

// Step 3. Executing the crawl request with instructions to surface only pages about citrus fruits
response = await tvly.crawl(start_url, {
  max_depth: 3,
  limit: 50,
  instructions: "Find all pages on citrus fruits"
});

// Step 4. Printing pages matching the query
for (let result of response.results) {
  console.log(`URL: ${result.url}`);
  console.log(`Raw Content: ${result.rawContent.substring(0, 200)}...`);
}
```

# Tavily Map (Open-Access Beta)

Map lets you discover and visualize the structure of a website starting from a base URL.

## Usage

Below are some code snippets that demonstrate how to interact with our Map API. Each step and component of this code is explained in greater detail in the API Methods section below.

### Mapping a website with instructions

```javascript
const { tavily } = require("@tavily/core");

// Step 1. Instantiating your Tavily client
const tvly = tavily({ apiKey: "tvly-YOUR_API_KEY" });

// Step 2. Defining the starting URL
const start_url = "https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon"

// Step 3. Executing the map request with parameters to focus on specific pages
response = await tvly.map(start_url, {
  max_depth: 3,
  limit: 50,
  instructions: "Find all pages on citrus fruits"
});

// Step 4. Printing the site structure
for (let url of response.results) {
  console.log(`URl: ${url}`);
}
```
